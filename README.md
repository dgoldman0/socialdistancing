# An Epidemic Model Analyzing Social Distancing

Social distancing is being attempted to limit the impact of the coronavirus, but little has been done to ensure that social distancing of this kind will be safe and effective.

## Models
- [Basic SEIR model](https://github.com/dgoldman0/socialdistancing/blob/master/seir.py)
- [Inclusion of low and high risk categories](https://github.com/dgoldman0/socialdistancing/blob/master/seir2.py)
- [Analysis of curves varying the level of social distancing of low risk group](https://github.com/dgoldman0/socialdistancing/blob/master/seir3.py)
- [Analysis of relative mortality rates at varying levels of social distancing](https://github.com/dgoldman0/socialdistancing/blob/master/seir4.py)

## Summary of Analysis

While a degree of social distancing seems to be effective at flattening the curve, extreme social distancing simply delays the progression of the epidemic. Furthermore, certain parameters can actually increase the overall mortality level.

The most effective option seems to be to increase social distancing for at risk, and between low and high risk populations. A reduction in contact rate of more than 50% for the low risk population does not seem reasonable, based on the model evaluation.
